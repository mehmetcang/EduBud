# EduBud-Online-Social-App-main
EduBud application will be design to appeal both students and academics. The home
screen should feature a resource library that can be filtered by users' interests. In addition,
various features that can help students solve the challenges they may face throughout their
educational lives should be included in the application. For example, features such as a social
networking platform for Erasmus students, a career counseling service for students, or a
research support program for academics can make the application more useful.

EduBud’s main idea is eliminate the lack of Turkish resources for intermediate sections, lessons and create a warm and more friendly ecosystem. In this ecosystem everyone who wants to share their knowledge can share it with users of our app.

We want EduBud to be a whole social academic application. That's why we initially targeted undergraduate students and teachers. EduBud will not only help people for making new friends, but it will also give them a first-hand opportunity to find the most appropriate resources for the courses they are struggling with.

If there is a lesson that you find very difficult, don't worry because there is someone in the world who has mastered that lesson. You will be able to find people who can explain the basic points to you with a picture or a voice recording. In addition to all this, you will also be able to see who else is studying the lesson you are studying instantly. With this feature, you will be able to discover the common points you have difficulty with in the lessons and make pinpoint steps to solve them.
